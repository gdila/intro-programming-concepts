# Intro to Programming Concepts

Slides and materials are hosted at [http://gdila.github.io/intro-programming-concepts](http://gdila.github.io/intro-programming-concepts).

## Course description

Are you interested in learning the basics of how computers operate and how code works? Have you ever taken a programming class and given up because the concepts were too hard to grasp, or all the examples used math formulas and your wall went up? Or have you stayed away from programming altogether, because you're worried that's what will happen? If you answered "Yes!" to even one of those questions, this class is for you!

In this workshop, we'll explore some of the most basic and universal programming concepts. We'll use everyday activities and real-life examples to demonstrate common structures such as If/Then/Else statements and different kinds of loops. We'll also try to take the mystery out of variables, and we'll talk about why computers are so picky.

### Prerequisites

None! This will truly be an introductory class. If you've taken GDI's Intro to JavaScript or any equivalent classes and successfully completed the exercises, this class is not for you. If you're a programmer by profession, this class is not for you.
